# Learning ExpressJS with MongoDB and AngularJS.

Made while reading the tutorial at http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/ with slight modifications, instead of usign `jQuery` I used `AngularJS` simply because I'm used to it more.

I've also included Bootstrap also because it's quicker for me to build on top of it.

# Setting up
* Clone the repo.
* `bower install && npm install`.
* Setup the MongoDB daemon in `localhost:27017/learnexpress`. If you're using another database name, change the `learnexpress` bit.
* `npm start` to serve, web app then can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/`
